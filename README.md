# Beautified trivia


This is a deliberately poorly written simulation of a trivia game.

GameRunner class just simulates the game, it is not part of the task to change it.

Game class contains everything - poorly written buggy code without specifications or tests. 

<h4>Where do you start?</h4>

- Figure out how the game is supposed to work
- Identify bugs - where Game does not behave as you would guess it should
- Evaluate the design

<h4>What result we expect to receive</h4>
- Refactor the application to be easy to test, read, and maintain
- Log identified bugs 
- Game progress is tracked in system.out (console) so keep those
- Have ready an explanation of what you changed, refactored or redesigned and <b>why</b>
- Attempt to apply design patterns
- Think ahead of possible extensions of the game (adding more players, question categories, larger board, etc)


We do not expect you to spend more than a few hours on this task, do not attempt to deploy it to AWS, 
write contract tests, run through user acceptance, migrate to Springboot, run through a REST API, etc.
This task is not about that.
